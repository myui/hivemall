`each_top_k(int k, ANY group, double value, arg1, arg2, ..., argN)` returns a top-k records for each `group`. It returns a relation consists of `(int rank, double value, arg1, arg2, .., argN)`.

This function is particularly useful for applying a similarity/distance function where the computation complexity is **O(nm)**.

`each_top_k` is very fast when compared to other methods running top-k queries (e.g., [`rank/distributed by`](https://ragrawal.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/extract-top-n-records-in-each-group-in-hadoophive/)) in Hive.

## Caution
* `each_top_k` is supported from Hivemall v0.3.2-3 or later.
* This UDTF assumes that input records are sorted by `group`. Use `DISTRIBUTED BY group SORTED BY group` to ensure that. Or, you can use `LEFT OUTER JOIN` for certain cases.
* It takes variable lengths arguments in `argN`. 
* The third argument `value` is used for the comparison.
* `Any number types` or `timestamp` are accepted for the type of `value`.
* If k is less than 0, reverse order is used and `tail-K` records are returned for each `group`.
* Note that this function returns [a pseudo ranking](http://www.michaelpollmeier.com/selecting-top-k-items-from-a-list-efficiently-in-java-groovy/) for top-k. It always returns `at-most K` records for each group. The ranking scheme is similar to `dense_rank` but slightly different in certain cases.

# Usage

## top-k clicks 

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9390698/hive-getting-top-n-records-in-group-by-query/32559050#32559050

```sql
set hivevar:k=5;

select
  page-id, 
  user-id,
  clicks
from (
  select
    each_top_k(${k}, page-id, clicks, page-id, user-id)
      as (rank, clicks, page-id, user-id)
  from (
    select
      page-id, user-id, clicks
    from
      mytable
    DISTRIBUTE BY page-id SORT BY page-id
  ) t1
) t2
order by page-id ASC, clicks DESC;
```

## Top-k similarity computation

```sql
set hivevar:k=10;

SELECT
  each_top_k(
    ${k}, t2.id, angular_similarity(t2.features, t1.features), 
    t2.id, 
    t1.id,  
    t1.y
  ) as (rank, similarity, base_id, neighbor_id, y)
FROM
  test_hivemall t2 
  LEFT OUTER JOIN train_hivemall t1;
```

### Explicit grouping using `distribute by` and `sort by`

```sql
SELECT
  each_top_k(
    10, id1, angular_similarity(features1, features2), 
    id1, 
    id2,  
    y
  ) as (rank, similarity, id, other_id, y)
FROM (
select
  t1.id as id1,
  t2.id as id2,
  t1.features as features1,
  t2.features as features2,
  t1.y
from
  train_hivemall t1
  CROSS JOIN test_hivemall t2
DISTRIBUTE BY id1 SORT BY id1
) t;
```

### Parallelization of similarity computation using WITH clause

```sql
create table similarities

  features

  t03 t2 
  LEFT OUTER JOIN train_hivemall t1

select * from s01
union all
select * from s02
union all

```

## tail-K

```sql
set hivevar:k=-10;

SELECT
