Prerequisite
============
* [hivemall.jar](https://github.com/myui/hivemall/tree/master/target/hivemall.jar)
* [conv.awk](https://github.com/myui/hivemall/tree/master/scripts/misc/conv.awk)
* [define-all.hive](https://github.com/myui/hivemall/tree/master/scripts/ddl/define-all.hive)

Data preparation
================

```sh
cd /mnt/archive/datasets/regression/E2006-tfidf
awk -f conv.awk E2006.train > E2006.train.tsv
awk -f conv.awk  E2006.test > E2006.test.tsv

hadoop fs -mkdir -p /dataset/E2006-tfidf/train
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /dataset/E2006-tfidf/test
hadoop fs -put E2006.train.tsv /dataset/E2006-tfidf/train
hadoop fs -put E2006.test.tsv /dataset/E2006-tfidf/test
```

```sql
create database E2006;
use E2006;

delete jar /home/myui/tmp/hivemall.jar;
add jar /home/myui/tmp/hivemall.jar;

source /home/myui/tmp/define-all.hive;

Create external table e2006tfidf_train (
  rowid int,
  target float,
  features ARRAY<STRING>
) 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY "," 
STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION '/dataset/E2006-tfidf/train';

Create external table e2006tfidf_test (
  rowid int, 
  target float,
  features ARRAY<STRING>
) 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY "," 
STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION '/dataset/E2006-tfidf/test';

create table e2006tfidf_test_exploded as
select 
  rowid,
  target,
  split(feature,":")[0] as feature,
  cast(split(feature,":")[1] as float) as value
  -- hivemall v0.3.1 or later
  -- extract_feature(feature) as feature,
  -- extract_weight(feature) as value
from 
  e2006tfidf_test LATERAL VIEW explode(addBias(features)) t AS feature;
```

## Amplify training examples (global shuffle)
```sql
-- set mapred.reduce.tasks=32;
set hivevar:seed=31;
set hivevar:xtimes=3;
create or replace view e2006tfidf_train_x3 as 
select * from (
select amplify(${xtimes}, *) as (rowid, target, features) from e2006tfidf_train
) t
CLUSTER BY rand(${seed});
-- set mapred.reduce.tasks=-1;
```
