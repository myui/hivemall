A trainer learns the function f(x)=y, or weights _W_, of the following form to predict a label y where x is a feature vector.
_y=f(x)=Wx_

Without a bias clause (or regularization), f(x) cannot make a hyperplane that divides (1,1) and (2,2) becuase f(x) crosses the origin point (0,0).

With bias clause b, a trainer learns the following f(x).
_f(x)=Wx+b_ 
Then, the predicted model considers bias existing in the dataset and the predicted hyperplane does not always cross the origin.

**addBias()** of Hivemall, adds a bias to a feature vector. 
To enable a bias clause, use addBias() for **both**_(important!)_ training and test data as follows.
The bias _b_ is a feature of "0" ("-1" in before v0.3) by the default. See [AddBiasUDF](https://github.com/myui/hivemall/blob/master/src/main/hivemall/ftvec/AddBiasUDF.java) for the detail.

Note that Bias is expressed as a feature that found in all training/testing examples.

# Adding a bias clause to test data
```sql
create table e2006tfidf_test_exploded as
select 
  rowid,
  target,
  split(feature,":")[0] as feature,
  cast(split(feature,":")[1] as float) as value
  -- extract_feature(feature) as feature, -- hivemall v0.3.1 or later
  -- extract_weight(feature) as value     -- hivemall v0.3.1 or later
from 
  e2006tfidf_test LATERAL VIEW explode(addBias(features)) t AS feature;
```

# Adding a bias clause to training data
```
create table e2006tfidf_pa1a_model as
select 
 feature,
 avg(weight) as weight
from 
 (select 
     pa1a_regress(addBias(features),target) as (feature,weight)
  from 
     e2006tfidf_train_x3
 ) t 
group by feature;
```
