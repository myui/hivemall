# Data preparation

First, downlod MovieLens dataset from the following site.
> http://www.grouplens.org/system/files/ml-1m.zip

Get detail about the dataset in the README.
> http://files.grouplens.org/papers/ml-1m-README.txt

You can find three dat file in the archive: 
> movies.dat, ratings.dat, users.dat.

Change column separator as follows:
```sh
sed 's/::/#/g' movies.dat > movies.t
sed 's/::/#/g' ratings.dat > ratings.t
sed 's/::/#/g' users.dat > users.t
```

Create a file named occupations.t with the following contents:
```
0#other/not specified
1#academic/educator
2#artist
3#clerical/admin
4#college/grad student
5#customer service
6#doctor/health care
7#executive/managerial
8#farmer
9#homemaker
10#K-12 student
11#lawyer
12#programmer
13#retired
14#sales/marketing
15#scientist
16#self-employed
17#technician/engineer
18#tradesman/craftsman
19#unemployed
20#writer
```

# Importing data as Hive tables

## create tables
```sql
create database movielens;
use movielens;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ratings (
  userid INT, 
  movieid INT,
  rating INT, 
  tstamp STRING
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '#'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/dataset/movielens/ratings';

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE movies (
  movieid INT, 
  title STRING,
  genres ARRAY<STRING>
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '#'
COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY "|"
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/dataset/movielens/movies';

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE users (
  userid INT, 
  gender STRING, 
  age INT,
  occupation INT,
  zipcode STRING
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '#'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/dataset/movielens/users';

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE occupations (
  id INT,
  occupation STRING
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '#'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/dataset/movielens/occupations';
```

## load data into tables
```sh
hadoop fs -put ratings.t /dataset/movielens/ratings
hadoop fs -put movies.t /dataset/movielens/movies
hadoop fs -put users.t /dataset/movielens/users
hadoop fs -put occupations.t /dataset/movielens/occupations
```

# Create a concatenated table 
```sql
CREATE TABLE rating_full
as
select 
  r.*, 
  m.title as m_title,
  concat_ws('|',sort_array(m.genres)) as m_genres, 
  u.gender as u_gender,
  u.age as u_age,
  u.occupation as u_occupation,
  u.zipcode as u_zipcode
from
  ratings r 
  JOIN movies m ON (r.movieid = m.movieid)
  JOIN users u ON (r.userid = u.userid);
```

hive> desc rating_full;
```
userid                  int                     None
movieid                 int                     None
rating                  int                     None
tstamp                  string                  None
m_title                 string                  None
m_genres                string                  None
u_gender                string                  None
u_age                   int                     None
u_occupation            int                     None
u_zipcode               string                  None
```

# Creating training/testing data

Create a training/testing table such that each has 80%/20% of the original rating data.

```sql
-- Adding rowids to the rating table
SET hivevar:seed=31;
CREATE TABLE ratings2
as
select
  rand(${seed}) as rnd, 
  userid, 
  movieid, 
  rating
from 
  ratings;

CREATE TABLE training
as
select * from ratings2
order by rnd DESC
limit 800000;

CREATE TABLE testing
as
select * from ratings2
order by rnd ASC
limit 200209;
```
