# Data preparation

First of all, please create `ratings` table described in the following page: 
https://github.com/myui/hivemall/wiki/MovieLens-Dataset

```sql
use movielens;

SET hivevar:seed=31;

DROP TABLE ratings_fm;
CREATE TABLE ratings_fm
as
select
	rowid() as rowid,
	categorical_features(array("userid","movieid"), userid, movieid) 
	  as features,
	rating,
	rand(${seed}) as rnd
from
	ratings
CLUSTER BY rand(43); -- shuffle training input

select * from ratings_fm limit 2;
```

| rowid | features | rating | rnd |
|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|:---:|
| 1-383970 | ["userid#2244","movieid#1272"] | 5 | 0.33947035987020546 |
| 1-557913 | ["userid#3425","movieid#2791"] | 4 | 0.12344886396954391 |

```sql
-- use 80% for training
DROP TABLE training_fm;
CREATE TABLE training_fm
as
select * from ratings_fm
order by rnd DESC
limit 800000;

-- use 20% for testing
DROP TABLE testing_fm;
CREATE TABLE testing_fm
as
select * from ratings_fm
order by rnd ASC
limit 200209;

-- testing table for prediction
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW testing_fm_exploded
as 
select 
  rowid,
  extract_feature(fv) as feature,
  extract_weight(fv) as Xi,
  rating
from
  testing_fm t1 LATERAL VIEW explode(add_bias(features)) t2 as fv;
```
_Caution: Don't forget to call `add_bias` in the above query. No need to call `add_bias` for preparing training data in Factorization Machines because it always considers it._

# Training

## Hyperparamters for Training
```sql
-- number of factors
set hivevar:factor=10;
-- maximum number of training iterations
set hivevar:iters=50;
```

## Build a prediction mdoel by Factorization Machine

```sql
drop table fm_model;
create table fm_model
as
select
  feature,
  avg(Wi) as Wi,
  array_avg(Vif) as Vif
from (
  select 
    train_fm(features, rating, "-factor ${factor} -iters ${iters} -eta 0.01") 
    	as (feature, Wi, Vif)
  from 
    training_fm
) t
group by feature;
```

_Note: setting eta option is optional. However, setting `-eta 0.01` usually works well._

## Usage of `train_fm`

You can get usages of `train_fm` by giving `-help` option as follows:
```sql
select 
  train_fm(features, rating, "-help") as (feature, Wi, Vif)
from 
  training_fm
```

```

# Fast Factorization Machines Training using Int Features

Training of Factorization Machines (FM) can be done more efficietly, in term of speed, by using INT features.
In this section, we show how to run FM training by using int features, more specifically by using [feature hashing](https://github.com/myui/hivemall/wiki/Feature-hashing).

```sql
set hivevar:factor=10;
set hivevar:iters=50;

drop table fm_model;
create table fm_model
as
select
  feature,
  avg(Wi) as Wi,
  array_avg(Vif) as Vif
from (
  select 
    train_fm(feature_hashing(features), rating, "-factor ${factor} -iters ${iters} -eta 0.01 -int_feature")  -- internally use a sparse map
 -- train_fm(feature_hashing(features), rating, "-factor ${factor} -iters ${iters} -eta 0.01 -int_feature -num_features 16777216") -- internally use a dense array 
        as (feature, Wi, Vif)
  from 
    training_fm
) t
group by feature;
```

```sql
set hive.mapjoin.optimized.hashtable=false; -- workaround for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11051

WITH predicted as (
  select
    t1.rowid,
    fm_predict(p1.Wi, p1.Vif, t1.Xi) as predicted
  from 
    testing_fm_exploded t1
    LEFT OUTER JOIN fm_model p1 ON (feature_hashing(t1.feature) = p1.feature)
  group by
    t1.rowid
)
select
  mae(p.predicted, rating) as mae,
  rmse(p.predicted, rating) as rmse
from
  testing_fm as t
  JOIN predicted as p on (t.rowid = p.rowid);
```
