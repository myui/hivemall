[Cross-validation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validationk-fold cross validation) is a model validation technique for assessing how a prediction model will generalize to an independent data set. This example shows a way to perform [k-fold cross validation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation) to evaluate prediction performance.

*Caution:* Matrix factorization is supported in Hivemall v0.3 or later.

# Data set creating for 10-folds cross validation.
```sql
use movielens;

set hivevar:kfold=10;
set hivevar:seed=31;

-- Adding group id (gid) to each training instance
drop table ratings_groupded;
create table ratings_groupded
as
select
  rand_gid2(${kfold}, ${seed}) gid, -- generates group id ranging from 1 to 10
  userid, 
  movieid, 
  rating
from
  ratings
cluster by gid, rand(${seed});
```

## Set training hyperparameters

```sql
-- latent factors
set hivevar:factor=10;
-- maximum number of iterations
set hivevar:iters=50;
-- regularization parameter
set hivevar:lambda=0.05;
-- learning rate
set hivevar:eta=0.005;
-- conversion rate (if changes between iterations became less or equals to ${cv_rate}, the training will stop)
set hivevar:cv_rate=0.001;
```
_Due to [a bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8396) in Hive, do not issue comments in CLI._

```sql
select avg(rating) from ratings;
```
> 3.581564453029317

```sql
-- mean rating value (Optional but recommended to set ${mu})
set hivevar:mu=3.581564453029317;
```
_Note that it is not necessary to set an exact value for ${mu}._

## SQL-generation for 10-folds cross validation

Run [generate_cv.sh](https://gist.github.com/myui/c2009e5791cca650a4d0) and create [generate_cv.sql](https://gist.github.com/myui/2e2018217e2188222655).

Then, issue SQL queies in [generate_cv.sql](https://gist.github.com/myui/2e2018217e2188222655) to get MAE/RMSE.

> 0.6695442192077673 (MAE)

> 0.8502739040257945 (RMSE)

_We recommend to use [Tez](http://tez.apache.org/) for running queries having many stages._
