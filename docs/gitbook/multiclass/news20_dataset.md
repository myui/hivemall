Get the news20 dataset.

```sh
$ cat <<EOF > conv.awk
BEGIN{ FS=" " }
{
    label=\$1;
    features=\$2;
    for(i=3;i<=NF;i++)
    {
        features = features "," \$i;
    }
    print NR "\t" label "\t" features;
}
END{}

$ gawk -f conv.awk news20.scale > news20_scale.train
$ gawk -f conv.awk news20.t.scale > news20_scale.test
```

## Putting data on HDFS
```sh
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /dataset/news20-multiclass/train
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /dataset/news20-multiclass/test

hadoop fs -copyFromLocal news20_scale.train /dataset/news20-multiclass/train
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal news20_scale.test /dataset/news20-multiclass/test
```
