# Apache Hivemall Overview

Apache Hivemall is a scalable machine learning library that runs on Apache Hive/Pig/Spark. Apache Hivemall is designed to be scalable to the number of training instances as well as the number of training features.


Supported Algorithms
--------------------

Apache Hivemall provides machine learning functionality as well as feature engineering functions through UDFs/UDAFs/UDTFs of Hive.

## Binary Classification

* [Perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

* Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)

* Confidence Weighted (CW)

* Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)

* Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)

* AdaGradRDA (w/ hinge loss)

* Factorization Machine (w/ logistic loss)

_My recommendation is AROW, SCW1, AdaGradRDA, and Factorization Machine while it depends._

## Multi-class Classification

* [Perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

* Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)

* Confidence Weighted (CW)

* Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)

* Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)

* Random Forest Classifier

* Gradient Tree Boosting (_Experimental_)

_My recommendation is AROW and SCW while it depends._

## Regression

* [Logistic Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) using [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)

* AdaGrad, AdaDelta (w/ logistic Loss)

* Passive Aggressive Regression (PA1, PA2)

* AROW regression

* Random Forest Regressor

* Factorization Machine (w/ squared loss)

* [Polynomial Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)

_My recommendation for is AROW regression, AdaDelta, and Factorization Machine while it depends._

## Recommendation

* [Minhash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash) ([LSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) with jaccard index)

* [Matrix Factorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition) (sgd, adagrad)

* Factorization Machine (squared loss for rating prediction)

## k-Nearest Neighbor

* [Minhash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash) ([LSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) with jaccard index)

* b-Bit minhash

* Brute-force search using Cosine similarity

## Anomaly Detection

* [Local Outlier Factor (LOF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_outlier_factor)

## Natural Language Processing

* English/Japanese Text Tokenizer

## Feature engineering

* [Feature Hashing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing) (MurmurHash, SHA1)

* [Feature scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) (Min-Max Normalization, Z-Score)

* [Polynomial Features](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel)

* Feature instances amplifier that reduces iterations on training

* [TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) vectorizer

* Bias clause

* Data generator for one-vs-the-rest classifiers

System requirements
--------------------
