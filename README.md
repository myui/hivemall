Hivemall: Hive scalable machine learning library
=================================================

Hivemall is a scalable machine learning library running on Hive/Hadoop, licensed under the LGPL 2.1.  
Hivemall is designed to be scalable to the number of training instances as well as the number of training features.

Supported Algorithms
--------------------

Hivemall provides machine learning functionality as well as feature engineering functions 
through UDFs/UDAFs/UDTFs of Hive.

## Classfication

* Perceptron

* Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)

* Confidence Weighted (CW)

* Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)

* Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)

## Regression

* Logistic Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent
  (parameter mixing and iterative parameter mixing)
  
* Passive Aggressive Regression (PA1, PA2)

## Ensemble

* Bagging

## Loss functions

* SquaredLoss, LogisticLoss, HingeLoss, SquaredHingeLoss, QuantileLoss, EpsilonInsensitiveLoss

## Feature engineering
  
* Feature hashing (MurmurHash, SHA1)

* Feature scaling (Min-Max Normalization, Z-Score)

* Feature instances amplifier that reduces iterations on training

* Bias clause

System requirements
--------------------

* Hive 0.9 or later

* Hadoop 0.20.x (CDH3 is our target)

Basic Usage
------------

```sql
SELECT 
  feature, 
  CAST(avg(weight) as FLOAT) as weight
FROM
 (SELECT logress(features,label) as (feature,weight) FROM training_features) t
GROUP BY feature;
```
