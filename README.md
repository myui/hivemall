Hivemall is a scalable machine learning library that runs on Apache Hive.
Hivemall is designed to be scalable to the number of training instances as well as the number of training features.

Supported Algorithms
--------------------

Hivemall provides machine learning functionality as well as feature engineering functions through UDFs/UDAFs/UDTFs of Hive. 

## Binary Classification

* [Perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

* Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)

* Confidence Weighted (CW)

* Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)

* Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)

* AdaGradRDA (w/ hinge loss)

* Factorization Machine (w/ logistic loss)

_My recommendation is AROW, SCW1, AdaGradRDA, and Factorization Machine while it depends._

## Multi-class Classification

* [Perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

* Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)

* Confidence Weighted (CW)

* Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)

* Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)

* Random Forest Classifier

* Gradient Tree Boosting (_Experimental_)

_My recommendation is AROW and SCW while it depends._

## Regression

* [Logistic Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) using [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)

* AdaGrad, AdaDelta (w/ logistic Loss)
  
* Passive Aggressive Regression (PA1, PA2)

* AROW regression

* Random Forest Regressor

* Factorization Machine (w/ squared loss)

* [Polynomial Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)

_My recommendation for is AROW regression, AdaDelta, and Factorization Machine while it depends._

## Recommendation

* [Minhash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash) ([LSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) with jaccard index)

* [Matrix Factorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition) (sgd, adagrad)

* Factorization Machine (squared loss for rating prediction)

## k-Nearest Neighbor

* [Minhash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash) ([LSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) with jaccard index)

* b-Bit minhash

* Brute-force search using Cosine similarity

## Anomaly Detection

* [Local Outlier Factor (LOF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_outlier_factor)

## Natural Language Processing

* English/Japanese Text Tokenizer

## Feature engineering
  
* [Feature Hashing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing) (MurmurHash, SHA1)

* [Feature scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) (Min-Max Normalization, Z-Score)

* [Polynomial Features](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel)

* Feature instances amplifier that reduces iterations on training

* [TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) vectorizer

* Bias clause

* Data generator for one-vs-the-rest classifiers

System requirements
--------------------

* Hive 0.12 or later

* Java 7 or later

  _Note: It would work for Java 6 except hivemall-nlp but we recommend to use Java 7 or later._
