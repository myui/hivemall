**News:** Hivemall joins [Apache Incubator](http://hivemall.incubator.apache.org/)! :tada: Currently in the process of moving the project repository to ASF. This repository will be deprecated soon. Please move your stars and forks to [the new repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hivemall).

[![Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/images/egg-logo2.png "Apache Incubator")](http://hivemall.incubator.apache.org/)

Hivemall is a scalable machine learning library that runs on Apache Hive, Apache Spark, and Apache Pig. Hivemall is designed to be scalable to the number of training instances as well as the number of training features.
